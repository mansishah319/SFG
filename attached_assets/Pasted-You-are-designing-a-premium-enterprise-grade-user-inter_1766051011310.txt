You are designing a premium, enterprise-grade user interface for a Strategic Foresight platform.
This is a DESIGN-ONLY task.

DESIGN GOAL:
The UI must feel modern, futuristic, clean, and executive-level — similar to high-end SaaS platforms used by governments and global enterprises.
Avoid default layouts, generic cards, or basic dashboards.

Use the attached reference image as a benchmark for:
- Visual sophistication
- Typography hierarchy
- White space usage
- Minimalist yet expressive design

DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW:

1. VISUAL LANGUAGE
- Use large, confident typography for headings.
- Use subtle gradients, soft shadows, and glassmorphism effects.
- Prefer blurred backgrounds, layered surfaces, and depth.
- Avoid boxed layouts; use floating panels and modular sections.
- Design should feel calm, authoritative, and intelligent.

2. LAYOUT & COMPOSITION
- Use asymmetrical layouts where appropriate.
- Left navigation should be slim, icon-driven, and visually quiet.
- Main content area should breathe — generous spacing, clear sections.
- Avoid clutter. Every element must earn its place.

3. COLOR & BRAND TREATMENT
- Follow the Dubai Police color palette and design system.
- Use primary colors sparingly for emphasis.
- Use secondary and sub-colors for data states, highlights, and accents.
- Apply color through gradients, dividers, hover states, and micro-highlights — not heavy fills.

4. TYPOGRAPHY
- Use a modern sans-serif font system.
- Clear hierarchy:
  - Page titles: large and bold
  - Section headers: medium weight
  - Body text: light and readable
- Avoid dense text blocks. Use short descriptions and spacing.

5. COMPONENT STYLE
- Cards should:
  - Have soft rounded corners
  - Subtle shadow or frosted-glass effect
  - Clear title, meta information, and action area
- Buttons should:
  - Be minimal, with hover and focus states
  - Avoid heavy borders
- Tables should:
  - Feel lightweight
  - Use dividers and spacing instead of strong grid lines

6. MOTION & INTERACTION (VISUAL ONLY)
- Design for smooth transitions:
  - Hover elevation
  - Fade-in sections
  - Slide transitions between states
- Avoid abrupt changes.

7. AI / FUTURISTIC FEEL
- Use visual cues that imply intelligence:
  - Subtle data glow
  - Progress indicators
  - Context panels
- Avoid literal AI icons or gimmicks.

SCREENS TO DESIGN (NO LOGIC):
- Landing / Login screen:
  - Split layout with content on left, login on right
  - Futuristic background
  - Minimal fields (username, password)
- Super Admin Dashboard:
  - High-level metric cards
  - Elegant navigation
- Admin Dashboard:
  - Clean workflow-focused views
- Scenario Planning & Retreat overview screens
- User Management screen with refined table design

STRICTLY AVOID:
- Bootstrap-style layouts
- Generic admin templates
- Overuse of icons
- Flat, lifeless UI
- Dense information walls

DELIVERABLE:
High-fidelity UI mockups rendered in code, focusing on layout, spacing, typography, and visual polish — not functionality.
