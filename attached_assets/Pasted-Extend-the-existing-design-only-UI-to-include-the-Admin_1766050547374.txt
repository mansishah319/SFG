Extend the existing design-only UI to include the Admin (SFD) interface for the Strategic Foresight platform.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT modify or redesign the Super Admin interface that has already been created.
- The Admin (SFD) will access the platform via the same landing and login screen.
- The interface rendered after login must depend on the user’s role associated with their email ID, not on any role selection screen.
- This is a design-only exercise. No logic or authentication required.

ADMIN (SFD) NAVIGATION STRUCTURE:
The Admin interface should include the following left-side navigation items:
- User Management
- Game Requests
- Scenario Planning
- Scenario Retreats
- Reports

USER MANAGEMENT:
- The User Management screen for Admin should be visually identical to the Super Admin’s User Management screen.
- No changes required in layout or interaction for this section.

GAME REQUESTS:
- Display a list of game requests submitted by Game Masters.
- Each request card or row should show:
  - Game Name
  - Requested By (Game Master name)
  - Department
  - Status
  - View button

- On clicking “View”, open a detailed Game Request page showing:
  - Game Master name
  - Department
  - Number of players
  - Proposed date and time
  - Focal issue
  - Selected theme(s)
  - Theme explanation
- Include visual action buttons:
  - Request Changes / Provide Feedback
  - Approve Game Request
- Feedback and approval actions are visual-only.

SCENARIO PLANNING & SCENARIO RETREATS:
- These sections should be visually consistent with the Super Admin views.
- Show:
  - Yet to Start
  - In Progress
  - Completed sessions
- Admin should have read-only visibility into sessions and reports.

REPORTS:
- Split the Reports section into two clear tabs:
  1. Approval Required
  2. Published Reports

- Approval Required:
  - Show reports submitted by Game Masters for approval.
  - On clicking “View”, display the full report in a readable, structured format.
  - Provide visual options to:
    - Add comments / feedback
    - Approve the report

- Published Reports:
  - Display all approved reports in a clean, searchable list.

DESIGN GUIDELINES:
- Maintain the same futuristic, modern, and sophisticated design language as Super Admin.
- Use subtle color cues to differentiate “Approval Required” vs “Published”.
- Ensure smooth visual flow and clarity without clutter.

GOAL:
Create a clear, executive-level Admin interface focused on governance, approvals, and oversight, while preserving the existing Super Admin design exactly as is.
